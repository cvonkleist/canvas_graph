I'm working with some large datasets and I couldn't easily find a line graph
plugin for jQuery or Prototype that weren't slow. This graph (dumbly) reduces
the number of data points to however many pixels are in the canvas, which means
100,000 data points graph almost as fast as 1,000 data points.

This is barely working.
